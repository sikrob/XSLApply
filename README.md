#XSLApply
## A tool written in Obj-C for performing XSLT by applying an XSL to an XML.

I wrote this and am putting it here on GitHub because I have written this tool numerous times in different languages for doing quick testing with XML and XSL and I'm tired of rewriting it and somehow always losing or deleting it. So onto the internet it goes!
